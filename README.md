# Prototype application for my BP for smart homes

This app serves as a showcase of Smart home application for my BP.
It is just a prototype, the final application would be done in either MAUI framework or other multiplatform soulution.

The WPF framework was used for simplicity.


For testing puposes you can use settings (VPN access needed):

- 192.168.1.100
- 192.168.1.100
- SmartHomedb
- messages
- uiDesktopApp
- passForUiDesktopApp

To Import data with the button on the Dashboard view just put the 'HomeControllerData' folder onto your Desktop. After the settings setup and import you should restart the application and you will get all the Dashboards with all the controls.

If you use Export All Data button, all the data will be exported to the folder on your desktop 'HomeControllerData'
